# CI-CD



## Getting started
This project is being developed as part of a master's degree course focused on microservices. For this project, I have been instructed to create multiple microservices with a server and a database, which will later be deployed to a self-hosted platform such as Coolify or Cloudron.

Along the way, a CI/CD pipeline will also be implemented, along with multiple technical features such as documentation (Swagger), security (HTTPS), and tests (unit tests, container tests, load tests).

I will continue to update this README to provide better visibility and understanding of the project.

## Set Up 
Now to get the project up and running you can either clone the repo and set up run the docker compose locally , or you can simply get the images from the docker hub (registry)
with the following command 

``` docker pull hannachiyou/myapp:latest ``` 

``` docker pull hannachiyou/mybd:latest ``` 

You can also find them here in the registry
